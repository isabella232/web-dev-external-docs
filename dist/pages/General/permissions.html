<p>It is imperative that changes to the following areas on Liferay.com are closely monitored since they can all have a significant impact on a user&#39;s experience.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Web Content</li>
    <li>Structures/Templates</li>
    <li>Documents &amp; Media</li>
    <li>DDLs</li>
    <li>Page Information</li>
</ul>
<p>The user roles and permissions outlined below help mitigate the possibility of accidentally breaking part/all of our site (You are all amazing and I know you would never do that. But... just in case.). With great power comes great responsibility. Use
    your powers wisely.</p>
