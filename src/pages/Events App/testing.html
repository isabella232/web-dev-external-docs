<p>When an event is first set up in the events app, the event is generally not active. This means that the user cannot actually access the event in the app. Instead, a custom message is displayed along with links for the event&#39;s microsite and registration
    page.</p>

<p>To test an event while it is still inactive, please follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the app (&quot;Select the event...&quot; screen show should).</li>
    <li>Hold the title bar (where it says &quot;Select the event...&quot;) for a few seconds</li>
    <li>The events list should now be surrounded by a red border, and it should be possible now to &quot;enter&quot; the event in the app.
