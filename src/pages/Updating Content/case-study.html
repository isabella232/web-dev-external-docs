<p>Adding new case studies to Liferay.com </p>

<p>Please note, before adding a Case Study to the site, consider whether to have DESIGN create an svg (scalable vector graphic) logo for the Case Study. Case Studies that are Highlighted include the company’s logo. If the Case Study is going to be a Highlighted study, please create that ticket first and then link it to the LRIS ticket.</p>
<p>Important information about the logo request made to design: 
Please try to provide Design with an svg. This may require hunting online through google image search.
Request logo be: size of 226x64 - or view box size of 0 0 226 64</p>
<p>If you have retrieved the svg logo from Design, carry on with the following instructions.</p>
