</p>
<h2 id="step-1-initiation">STEP 1: Initiation</h2>
<p>New site requests should be approved by a Marketing lead based on completeness of requirements and appropriate justification.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alignment - content/messaging/design/function is consistent and aligns with similar pages, marketing collateral, and/or other marketing efforts</li>
    <li>Metrics - performance for similar pages indicates there&#39;s a strong justification</li>
    <li>Translations - communication with Global Marketing regions has been made to determine whether translations are needed and when they will be available</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2-design-request">STEP 2: Design request</h2>
<p>If your project needs Design, please submit a Design for Web Request ticket in the LRDESIGN Project</p>
<h2 id="step-3-web-request">STEP 3: Web request</h2>
<p>Submit a ticket in the LRIS Project based on the following guidelines</p>
<ul>
    <li>Requirements are described in non-technical terms including critical dates (i.e., go-live date/time).</li>
    <li>Refer to Web Request Catalog (LRIS Section) to check that all the necessary requirements have been covered.</li>
    <li>Content/copy should be final upon ticket creation and attached, or a link provided.</li>
    <li>If content/copy has not been finalized, clearly state in the description when it will be completed.</li>

<h2 id="step-4-analysis">STEP 4: Analysis</h2>

    <li>Webteam will analyze the LRIS ticket and contact the requester for clarification or additional info by assigning the ticket back to the requester with a comment.</li>
    <li>Requester may provide clarification by commenting back on the ticket and re-assigning the ticket to the appropriate Webteam member, or contact Webteam directly with a response (at which point Webteam will assign the ticket back to themselves).</li>
    <li>Webteam will estimate the time to complete the request and schedule the ticket to be completed in a future sprint.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-5-implementation">STEP 5: Implementation</h2>
